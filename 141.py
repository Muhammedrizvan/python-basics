#you can use the ^operator
#instead of the symmetric_difference () method
#and yoy will get the same result

#use ^ to join two sets?

set1 = {"apple","banana","cheery"}
set2 = {"google","microsoft","apple"}

set3 = set1^set2
print(set3)

#the^ operator only allows you to join sts with sets
# and not with data type
#like you can with the symmetric_difference () method
