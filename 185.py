#in python , logical operators (and,or,and not)
#are used to combine or modify conditions to control the flow of a program


#and operator: returns true if both conditions are true
#or operator: returns true if at least one condition is true.

#not opertor :reverses the result of a condtion:
#if a condition is true not make it false and vice versa
